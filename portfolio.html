My project in scratch was making a basic maze where you had to navigate a tunnel without touching the sides of the tunnel.

It also got into the depths of how C worked at a very low level which I thought was very interesting. <a href="https://pastebin.com/ezesXsYB">Click here to see my code for the "Mario Less" project.</a></td>

While arrays on their own are fine, when used with some other C utilites, it makes arrays really shine. I really liked this lesson. <a href="https://pastebin.com/j55kQxdZ">Click here to see my code for the "Command Line Interaction" lab.</a></td>

I spent much more times on the labs and actually attempted to learn more by doing actual research. I enjoyed this unit because in the end, I felt like i acomplished a lot. <a href="https://pastebin.com/rM6K7DGG">Click here to see my code for the "Bubble Sort" lab.</a> </td>

I had to really research and watch many youtube tutorials to really start to even understand the things I was doing. (unfortunately I stopped saving the code on my computer so I cant share any more code past lesson 3)</td>

I found this quite funny because between my coding friend group, i am widely known as the person who isnt a big fan my python, to say the least. I usually prefer javascript and node as apposed to python, but I still gave it a shot. This was a very enjoyable lesson. </td>

I am even turning my HTML webpage project into a hosting page, in which you are reading this off of right now!</td>
